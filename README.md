# Student-Management-System
The Student Management System (SMS) is a web application built with the Django framework that allows educational institutions (e.g., schools, colleges, and universities) to manage student information efficiently. This system provides an easy-to-use interface for administrators, students, and faculty members to manage and view student profiles.
